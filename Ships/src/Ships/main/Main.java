//We must represent the main features and classes of ships. As attributes, we need to store the name,
// the number of anchors, the material with which it is built (wood, metal, fiberglassâ€¦) and its length (in metres).
// We are going to focus on four ship types:
//
//    Container ship, for which we must also store its capacity in TEU, a unit of measurement which is
//    equivalent to one container.
//    Bulk carrier, for which we need to know the number of load hatches (it is usually an odd number).
//    Ships.data.Tanker, for which we need to know if it has double helmet or not, and its capacity in tons.
//    Fishing boat, for which we will store the type of fishing (commercial, artisan or sport).
